## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/melodie/stayball-tester.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```


# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

# StayBall Tester

## Description
The purpose of this project is to act as a test for walking stability, for use in testing whether a prosthetic, exo, or other walking aid is effective at its goal of improving the stability of one's walking. The project itself is composed of a simple UI showing a green star in the center of the "play area", as well as a blue circle that starts in the center and then moves in accordance with a simple model of the dynamics of a ball rolling on a tilted plane, using a device equipped with accelerometers to inform the model's motion. The object of the "game" is to keep the blue circle as close to the green star as possible for the duration of a test. 

The basic idea is that a subject will be asked to walk at a normal, comfortable gait, first without a movement aid or with a movement aid that the researcher wants to test against, and play the game while walking. Then, the subject will be asked to switch to using the researcher's movement aid and play again. The thought here is that subjects scores will reflect whether the aid is actually improving their walking stability(1). There is a practice mode to allow subjects to be acclimated to the dynamics of the game, during which the green star periodically moves to random positions within the play area.

## Background
"Walking stability" may seem like a nebulous term, and even within the fields where the concept is most relevant, there is some debate over how to measure it. This project is acting under the assumption 

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
